# BlockBedrockBoats

Provides a toggleable block for Bedrock players using Geyser to join the server.

This was initially made as an experiment to prevent Bedrock players from joining an ice boat racing server, but I guess it could be used on other servers.

|Config|Description  |Valid inputs  |
|--|--|--|
|kick-message|What players will see if they get kicked|Anything alphanumeric (will always be red)|
|block-bedrock|True is active|true/false|

That's it, that's the plugin. My first plugin, for that matter. Enjoy!
